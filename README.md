I worked with TidyTuesday [spotify dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-01-21)  


For my vizualization I used Plotly package for Python. All the plots were exported in html (to save their interactivity). All graphs are presented with conclusions in the HTML-file I made up.
